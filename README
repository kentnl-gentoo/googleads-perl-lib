AdWords API Perl Client Library
================================================================

Google's AdWords services lets developers design computer programs that interact
directly with the AdWords platform. With these applications, advertisers and
third parties can more efficiently -- and creatively -- manage their large or
complex AdWords accounts and campaigns.

The AdWords API Perl Client Library makes it easier to write Perl clients to
programmatically access AdWords accounts. One of the main features of this
client library is that it hides SOAP layer from end user, which makes it
much more easier to interact with API. The outgoing and incoming SOAP messages
can be monitored and logged on demand.

The backbone of the client library is based on the SOAP::WSDL module. It
handles the serialization/de-serialization, transport, and generation of classes
for the entities defined in the AdWords API WSDLs. SOAP::WSDL, in turn, uses
SOAP::Lite under the hood for some operations. More information about
compatibility can be found in the Perl Compatibility section of this README.

The complete documentation for AdWords API is available at
https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/.

What's in the client library?
-----------------------------

The client library provides full access to all the functionality of the
AdWords API web services plus more. It includes:

  - Data classes: The client library provides all the necessary data classes.
    For example, it provides the Campaign data class for encapsulating campaign
    data. These classes are generated automatically from WSDLs and found under
    Google::Ads:AdWords::{API VERSION}.

  - Client class: The Google::Ads::AdWords::Client class provides methods for
    setting credentials for accessing AdWords accounts as well as for creating
    instances of the AdWords Service classes.

  - Helpful utilities: The utilities located under "Google::Ads::Common" help
    you manage handle API errors, manage images, fetch reports and others.

  - Logging class: This class provides simple methods for logging the SOAP XML
    messages of all requests and responses.

  - Examples: The Perl client library comes with code examples in the
    "examples/" directory. We encourage you to use code examples to get started
    writing your own application. All the code examples are runnable out of the
    box, but you will have to set your credentials in "~/adwords.properties" and
    you may be required to insert object IDs where you see "INSERT_***_HERE".
    You must specify the clientCustomerId HTTP header for most services,
    so make sure you set the clientId in "~/adwords.properties" to a valid
    customer ID. See the Basic Concepts guide for more details about headers:
    https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/basic-concepts#request_headers


How do I start?
---------------

1) Make sure you have Perl 5.14 or later installed. More information on Perl can
   be found at http://www.perl.org/. If you are installing in Windows read the
   important notes in the next section.

2) From this directory, run

     perl Build.PL

   to generate your Build file. This relies on having Module::Build
   pre-installed. Some warnings might be print out when running this command,
   continue with the installation.

3) The client library has a number of dependencies which are defined in the
   Build.PL script. If you are missing any modules, you'll receive a warning in
   step 2. You can install any dependencies manually using the CPAN shell
   (http://search.cpan.org/~andk/CPAN-1.9304/lib/CPAN.pm) or automatically by
   running

     (sudo) perl Build installdeps

   Note 1: Make sure Module::Build >= 0.36 is installed so you can use
           installdeps.
   Note 2: In certain Linux installations you'll need to install openssl first.
   Note 3: For Windows, follow the instructions under "Windows Installation"
   before starting this step.

4) Install this module, making use of the Build script generated in step 2:

     perl Build
     (sudo) perl Build install

5) Sign up for a Google Account, if you don't already have one, at
   https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount

6) Copy the sample 'adwords.properties' file to your home directory, and edit it
   to reflect the credentials for your Google Account.

7) Try running the code examples in the 'examples' directory.

8) Read over the documentation in 'docs/' to familiarize yourself with
   the various classes and methods in the client library.


Windows Installation
--------------------

The library is only supported on Windows for ActivePerl 5.14+ x86 (32bit
version).

Before following the "How do I start?" steps:

1) Install the MinGW module by executing 'ppm install MinGW' in the command
   prompt.
2) Install OpenSSL, which can be found at:
   https://code.google.com/p/openssl-for-windows/.
3) If installdeps errors on Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA stating that it cannot
   find .h files:
   - Note the root location of your openssl installation. This will be referred
   to as <openssl_dir> e.g. C:\openssl. Note the root location or your Perl
   installation e.g. C:\Perl. This will be referred to as <perl_dir>.
   - Copy the <openssl_dir>\include directory to <perl_dir>\lib\CORE.
   - Copy all the .dll files in <openssl_dir>\bin to <perl_dir>\lib\CORE.
   - Copy all the .lib files in <openssl_dir>\lib to <perl_dir>\lib\CORE.

Running the examples
---------------------

Examples can be run by executing the following on command line
from a sub-directory of the "examples/" directory,

  $ perl Example.pl

Some examples require you replace object IDs in where you see placeholder
like "INSERT_***_HERE"

Using test accounts for development
-----------------------------------

It is recommended that during development of your library, you use AdWords Test
Accounts, to find more information about these type of accounts visit:

  https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/test-accounts

Authorization Options
---------------------

Authorization in the client library is handled through different authorization
handlers attached to the Client object. The library supports the following
authorization protocols:

  - OAuth 2:

    This protocol provides a way to access an AdWords account without needing to
    retain the user credentials such as email and password, and it is the
    only way for you to authorize your API requests. An access token is
    required by the library to be able to send authorized requests against
    the API. This access token can be generated with the library via two
    different OAuth 2 handlers.

    The library Client object provides the get_oauth_2_applications_handler
    and the get_oauth_2_service_accounts_handler methods that
    allows you to get a reference of the OAuth2 authorization handler for
    Web/Installed Applications and the handler for Service Accounts,
    respectively.

    OAuth2 for Web/Installed Applications

    The handler for applications provides methods such as
    get_authorization_url() and issue_access_token() that can be used to follow
    the authorization flow (i.e. user request for consent) and generation of
    access and refresh tokens.

    Also pre-stored access and refresh tokens can be passed to the authorization
    handler using the method set_access_token() and set_refresh_token() to
    re-used tokens already authorized by the user, it is up to you to code the
    mechanism to preserve and restore these tokens.

    After setting access and refresh tokens the library will handle the refresh
    of access tokens automatically for you.

    See the example examples/oauth/generate_offline_credentials.pl for a
    comprehensive example on how to use this authorization protocol.

    OAuth2 for Service Accounts

    The handler for service accounts provides methods such as
    set_email_address(), set_pem_file() and set_delegated_email_address()
    that can be used to set the service account email address, private key
    file and the delegated account email address, respectively. These values
    can also be configured using the adwords.properties file.

    Keep in mind that the use of service accounts for accessing AdWords API
    requires user impersonation because a service account itself can't have
    direct access to an AdWords Account, that is why the delegated email address
    is a required parameter. Setting up impersonation requires setup a Google
    Apps Domain for business. Refer to this Help Center article for more
    information on this matter
    http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=162106&topic=2759255&ctx=topic

    Additionally to use service accounts with the library you must transform
    the private key file as provided by the API Console from PKCS12 format to
    PEM format with NO password (usually the API console sets its password as
    'notasecret'). In Linux/Unix environments with openssl installed this
    transformation can be easily done as follows:
    > openssl pkcs12 -in yourfile.p12 -out yourfile.pem -nodes


How do I enable logging?
------------------------

The client library uses a custom class for all logging purposes and is exposed
through the Google::Ads:AdWords::Logging module. This class relies in the
Log::Log4perl module for all its logging tasks and provides a default
configuration within the module which can be overriden by proving a
log4perl.conf file in your home directory.

There are two loggers within this class described below.

  - AWAPI_LIB_LOG: Logs all requests from the client library along with
    information such as the timestamp, authentication, service, method,
    request Id, response time, operations and units count. The default behavior
    is to log this information to "~/logs/aw_api_lib" relative to your project's
    home directory.

  - SOAP_XML_LOG: Logs all incoming and outgoing SOAP requests/responses. The
    default behavior is to log this information to "~/logs/soap_xml.log"
    relative to your project's home directory. Sensitive information, such as
    authentication tokens, will be stripped.

Logging can be enabled using the following methods.

  - Google::Ads::AdWords::Logging::enable_all_logging(); - Enables logging both
    loggers.

  - Google::Ads::AdWords::Logging::enable_soap_logging(); - Only enables logging
    of SOAP traffic.

  - Google::Ads::AdWords::Logging::enable_awapi_logging(); - Only enables
    logging of API requests.

You can use the methods of the Logger class directly for even more control over
how requests are logged.


Requests accounting
-------------------

The Client class keeps a live count of requests, operations, units consumed, etc
since it was instantiated. These counts are accessible using the methods
get_requests_count, get_failed_requests_count, get_units_count,
get_operations_count.

Specific information about the last executed request
is accessible using the method get_last_request_stats which returns an object of
type Google::Ads::AdWords::RequestStats.

Also, the last executed soap request and its response are available through the
methods: get_last_soap_request, get_last_soap_response.


Gzip support
------------

The library supports gzip compression in the transport layer by default. Based
in the LWP:UserAgent module, the compression is detected by checking the
contents of HTTP::Message::decodable.

If gzip does not appear as the encodings supported in HTTP::Message::decodable,
you need to make sure the Compress::Zlib module is installed.


Compatibility:
--------------

The library relies on the SOAP::WSDL module to send and receive all SOAP
traffic from and to the AdWords API servers, however multiple patches are
applied to the module in runtime in order to support all the services. In order
for these patches to get correctly applied version 2.00.10 of the SOAP::WSDL
module must be used and the Google::Ads::AdWords::Client module must be included
before any other of the library modules.
