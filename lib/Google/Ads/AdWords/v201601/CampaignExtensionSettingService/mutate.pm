=head1 NAME

Google::Ads::AdWords::v201601::CampaignExtensionSettingService::mutate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl data type class for the XML Schema defined element
mutate from the namespace https://adwords.google.com/api/adwords/cm/v201601.

Applies the list of mutate operations (add, remove, and set). <p> Beginning in v201509, add and set operations are treated identically. Performing an add operation on a campaign with an existing ExtensionSetting will cause the operation to be treated like a set operation. Performing a set operation on a campaign with no ExtensionSetting will cause the operation to be treated like an add operation. @param operations The operations to apply. The same {@link CampaignExtensionSetting} cannot be specified in more than one operation. @return The changed {@link CampaignExtensionSetting}s. @throws ApiException Indicates a problem with the request.
