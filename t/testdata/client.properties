# An OAuth2 refresh token.
# AdWords manager account service tests do not pass a clientCustomerId in the
# requests and instead rely on AdWords finding the gaia account associated with
# the OAuth token. As a result, tests of manager account related services will
# fail if this token did not come from a manager account.
# Furthermore, tests of non-manager account services will fail if this token is
# from an account that does not have permission to manage the account
# identified by clientId.
#
# Since non-test and test accounts cannot be linked, it
# follows from this that either:
#   clientId is a test account and this token was obtained
#   from a test manager account, in which case tests on manager account services
#   will fail
# or:
#   clientId is a non-test account and this token was obtained
#   from a non-test manager account, in which case tests on manager account
#   services will succeed
