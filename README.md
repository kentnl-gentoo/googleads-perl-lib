# AdWords API Perl Client Library

Google's [AdWords API](http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/) service lets developers design computer programs that
interact directly with the [AdWords
platform](https://adwords.google.com/select/Login). With these applications,
advertisers and third parties can more efficiently -- and creatively -- manage
their large or complex [AdWords](https://adwords.google.com/select/Login) accounts and campaigns.

[AdWords API](http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/) Perl Client Library makes it easier to write Perl clients to
programmatically access [AdWords](https://adwords.google.com/select/Login) accounts.
